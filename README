Webvi is a tool for downloading and playing videos from popular video
sharing websites such as YouTube. There are two interfaces: a plugin
for Video Disk Recorder (VDR), and a command line client. The two
interfaces are described in README.vdrplugin and README.webvi.

The common functionality of the VDR plugin and the command line client
is implemented in a Python library (src/libwebvi/webvi). C bindings
for the library are also provided (see src/libwebvi/libwebvi.h).

Supported video sites:

* Google Video [1]
* Metacafe
* MTV3 Katsomo
* ruutu.fi [2]
* Subtv
* SVT Play
* Vimeo
* YLE Areena [2]
* YouTube

[1] Only videos hosted by Google, YouTube, Vimeo and SVT

[2] Requires rtmpdump-yle
    (http://users.tkk.fi/~aajanki/rtmpdump-yle/index.html). Streaming
    does not work.

Known problems:

SVT Play: not all videos are working
MTV3 Katsomo and Subtv: often the connection is lost before the
  video is fully downloaded.

Because of the modular design it is possible to add support for new
sites quite easily. See doc/developers.txt for more information.
