VDR Plugin 'webvideo' Revision History
--------------------------------------

2008-06-25: Version 0.0.1

- Initial revision.

2008-07-24: Version 0.0.2

- Italian translation (thanks to Diego Pierotto)
- Support for mms URLs using libmms
- Guess the file extension from the Content-Type header, not from the
  defaultext tag
- New video service: YLE Areena (the web service of the Finland's
  national broadcasting company). Only partial support, some of the
  URLs do not work with libmms.
- Youtube: Download higher quality MPEG-4 videos

2008-08-20: Version 0.0.3

- Support for video search
- Updated Italian translation (thanks to Diego Pierotto)
- Try mmsh if mms protocol fails (requires libmms 0.4 or later). Most
  videos on YLE Areena seem to work after this fix.
- Fix segfault when deleting the plugin at VDR exit
- Youtube: switch back to low quality FLV videos because not all
  videos have MP4 version

2008-08-21: Version 0.0.4

- Updated Italian translation (thanks to Diego Pierotto)
- Include a workaround for a bug in the libmms header file mmsx.h
  which caused the compilation to fail
- Fix compiler warnings

2008-09-08: Version 0.0.5

- New video service: SVT Play. Contributed by Lars Olsson.
- More robust parsing of .asx files
- Workaround for buggy servers: if the server reports the Content-Type
  of a video file as text/plain do not use it for deciding the file
  extension. Try to extract the extension from the URL instead.
- Sort service names alphabetically

2008-12-06: Version 0.0.6

- French translation (Thanks to Bruno Roussel)
- Fixed Youtube parsing to accommodate to recent changes

2009-02-08: Version 0.1.0

- The downloader backend is now a separate server process. The user
  interface is no longer blocked while the plugin is waiting for a web
  server to respond.
- Support for streaming
- A new command line client that has the same capabilities as the plugin
  but can be used without VDR.
- Alternative URLs for videos. For example, Youtube module first tries
  to download high quality version, and falls back to standard version
  if high quality version is not available.
- Cleaning up of the XML menu scheme. New menu items: textfields, item
  lists, query buttons.
- Status page that lists uncompleted downloads
- Updated YouTube, Google, and SVTPlay modules to work with the recent
  changes on these sites

- German translation (contributed by Andre L.)
- Daemon stops downloads gracefully when client disconnects
- Fixed segfault when a menu title is NULL (this happened for
  example on YouTube search results page)
- sane filenames: no slashs, no dots in the beginning
- Try to start daemon process automatically if can't open a connection
- Removed busy polling when loading the main menu
- Remove temporary file if the request fails
- Ability to cancel downloads (through the status screen)
- URLencode function in the plugin was bogus: the percent encoded
  values should be in hex, not in decimal
- Fixed problem with downloads never finishing if the server sends
  shorter file than expected
- History forward skipped over one page
- SVTPlay: various improvements to the parsing of the web pages

2009-03-07: Version 0.1.2
